# Grain-palette-Rice-Type-Classification
GrainPalette is a deep learning-based project designed to classify different types of rice grains accurately. It leverages advanced image classification techniques using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and transfer learning models such as ResNet or VGG to identify rice varieties based on visual grain characteristics.
