Project Title:
GrainPalette: Rice Type Classification Using Deep Learning

Project Description:
GrainPalette is a deep learning-based project designed to classify different types of rice grains accurately. It leverages advanced image classification techniques using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and transfer learning models such as ResNet or VGG to identify rice varieties based on visual grain characteristics.

The system takes high-resolution images of rice grains and classifies them into predefined categories like Basmati, Jasmine, Long Grain, Short Grain, Brown Rice, and more. The goal is to automate and improve the traditional manual process of rice sorting, which is often time-consuming and error-prone.

This project is particularly useful in agriculture, food processing, and quality control, where grain identification plays a crucial role in grading, packaging, and exporting.

Key Features:
Image-based classification of rice types

Use of deep learning and transfer learning for improved accuracy

Web-based interface for easy accessibility (optional)

Real-time predictions and batch processing support

Can be extended to classify other grains or detect impurities

Technologies Used:
Python

TensorFlow / PyTorch

OpenCV

Keras

Streamlit / Flask (for web interface, if needed)

Jupyter Notebook (for development and model training)

Unique Selling Proposition (USP):
GrainPalette automates the rice classification process using deep learning, providing high accuracy and speed while reducing the need for manual inspection.
